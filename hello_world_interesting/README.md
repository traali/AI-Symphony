# Hello World with Interesting Detail

A simple Python console application that prints "Hello World!" along with an interesting fact about computing history.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher installed (download from https://www.python.org/).
- A terminal or command prompt.

## Setup
1. Clone or download this project to a local directory.
2. No installation of dependencies is needed (see `requirements.txt`).

## Running the Program
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/hello_world_interesting
   ```
2. Execute the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   Or, if on Unix-like systems and the file is executable:
   ```
   chmod +x main.py
   ./main.py
   ```

### Expected Output
```
Hello World!
Did you know? The first computer 'bug' was an actual moth found in a Harvard Mark II computer in 1947!
```

## Troubleshooting
- If `python` command not found, ensure Python is in your PATH or use `python3`.
- For errors, check Python version with `python --version`.

## Future Enhancements
- Add user input for custom greetings.
- Integrate more facts via a list or API.
